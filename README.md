Instructions on how to deploy containerized Data Analytics on Azure App Service.

# Required Tools
Please make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine.  
### Code Editor: Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
### git source-code management
https://git-scm.com/
### azure command line interface 'az'
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest (Azure CLI) 
### Docker for Windows
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

# Create an Azure DevOps project
We will use Azure DevOps to host the source-code and secondly utilize Azure Pipelines to automate build and deployment tasks.

* login at https://dev.azure.com using your corporate credentials.
* Pleasse refere to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops for further guidance.

# Clone the repository
In the project please proceed to "Repos".
Follow the instructions to clone the repository to your local computer.

# Download the example project for Bokeh
Please proceed to the following URL.  
**Please just perform the ZIP download and extract the content in the previously cloned git repository**
https://github.com/dariustehrani/bokeh-on-docker

# Test the Dockerfile
* Open Powershell (in Visual Studio Code use STRG+รถ on a german keyboard)
* CD into the project folder
* run ````docker build -t bokeh-on-docker:latest .````
* test the image by running ````docker run -p 8080:8080 -it bokeh-on-docker:latest````
* Open a browser and point it to http://localhost:8080
You should see a simple bokeh demo app.


# Azure Container Registry (azurecr.io)
This will create your your main container registry.
````az acr create -n ACRNAME -g MyResourceGroup --sku Standard````

azure container registry docker login
````az acr login --name ACRNAME -l westeurope````


# Shiny R on Microft Open R (ADVANCED USERS ONLY)
As building the R Packages take a lot of time, the following example separates the creation of the runtime container from the actual Shiny app container. This will save 18 Minutes on average per deployment. Secondly you might want to set up a scheduled trigger, e.g. on a weekly basis so that your base images always includes latest updates and patches.

### Microsoft R Open Shiny BASE Image
Build a CI/CD Pipeline for the base Image. 
https://github.com/dariustehrani/mro-shiny-base

### Microsoft R Open Shiny APP Image
The following example will build shiny app container. You will need to modify the FROM entry to reference your azure container registry.
````FROM YOUR.azurecr.io/mro-shiny-base:latest````

# Azure Pipeline Setup

### Create a new service principal (SP)
The SP will be used by Azure DevOps to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources on your behalf.

````az account show````  
````az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "bokehondocker" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/YOURSUBSCRIPTIONIDGOESHERE````
